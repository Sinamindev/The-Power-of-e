;===== Begin State Component Backup =======================================================================================================================================
;==========================================================================================================================================================================

;=========== Before proceeding verify that this computer supports xsave and xrstor ========================================================================================
;Bit #26 of rcx, written rcx[26], must be 1; otherwise xsave and xrstor are not supported by this computer.
;Preconditions: rax holds 1.
mov        rax, 1

;Execute the cpuid instruction
cpuid

;Postconditions: If rcx[26]==1 then xsave is supported.  If rcx[26]==0 then xsave is not supported.

;=========== Extract bit #26 and test it ==================================================================================================================================
and        rcx, 0x0000000004000000                          ;The mask 0x0000000004000000 has a 1 in position #26.  Now rcx is either all zeros or
															;has a single 1 in position #26 and zeros everywhere else.
cmp        rcx, 0                                           ;Is (rcx == 0)?
je         xsavenotsupported                                ;Skip the section that backs up state component data.

;========== Call the function to obtain the bitmap of state components ====================================================================================================

;Preconditions
mov        rax, 0x000000000000000d                          ;Place 13 in rax.  This number is provided in the Intel manual
mov        rcx, 0                                           ;0 is parameter for subfunction 0

;Call the function
cpuid                                                       ;cpuid is an essential function that returns information about the cpu

;Postconditions (There are 2 of these):

;1.  edx:eax is a bit map of state components managed by xsave.  At the time this program was written (2014 June) there were exactly 3 state components.  Therefore, bits
;    numbered 2, 1, and 0 are important for current cpu technology.
;2.  ecx holds the number of bytes required to store all the data of enabled state components. [Post condition 2 is not used in this program.]
;This program assumes that under current technology (year 2014) there are at most three state components having a maximum combined data storage requirement of 832 bytes.
;Therefore, the value in ecx will be less than or equal to 832.

;Precaution: As an insurance against a future time when there will be more than 3 state components in a processor of the X86 family the state component bitmap is masked to
;allow only 3 state components maximum.

mov        r15, 7                                           ;7 equals three 1 bits.
and        rax, r15                                         ;Bits 63-3 become zeros.
mov        r15, 0                                           ;0 equals 64 binary zeros.
and        rdx, r15                                         ;Zero out rdx.

;========== Save all the data of all three components except GPRs =========================================================================================================

;The instruction xsave will save those state components with on bits in the bitmap.  At this point edx:eax continues to hold the state component bitmap.

;Precondition: edx:eax holds the state component bit map.  This condition has been met by the two pops preceding this statement.
